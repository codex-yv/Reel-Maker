Reel Maker - Help Guide
====================

Overview:
---------
Reel Maker is a Python-based application that allows you to create a clip, specify the start and end times for clips, 
and generate multiple smaller video clips from a larger video file.
This can be useful for creating short, shareable video segments or for extracting specific parts of a video.

Requirements:
-------------
- Python 3.x
- tkinter (for GUI)
- customtkinter (for enhanced GUI components)
- moviepy (for video processing)

Installation Instructions:
--------------------------
1. Install Python 3.x from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
2. Install the required Python packages:
   - tkinter (usually pre-installed with Python)
   - customtkinter (can be installed via pip: `pip install customtkinter`)
   - moviepy (can be installed via pip: `pip install moviepy`)

Usage:
------
1. **Upload a Video**:
   - Click on the "Upload Video" button to select and upload a video file (only MP4 format supported).
   - Once uploaded, the video details such as file path, format, size, resolution, duration, and total frames will be displayed.

2. **Set Time Parameters for Clips**:
   - **Start Time (HH:MM:SS)**: Enter the start time for the section of the video you want to clip.
   - **End Time (HH:MM:SS)**: Enter the end time for the section of the video you want to clip.
   - **Clip Length (in Seconds)**: Define the length of each clip you want to generate (e.g., 10 seconds).

3. **Count Clips**:
   - After entering the time parameters, click on the "Count Clips" button to calculate how many clips will be generated from the video based on the given clip length.
   - The program will display the total number of clips and any remaining time (if the video duration is not perfectly divisible by the clip length).

4. **Generate Clips**:
   - Once the clips are counted, click the "Generate Clips" button to start creating the smaller video clips.
   - The clips will be saved in the "output" folder with filenames based on the clip name you provide.
   - The program will process the video and generate the clips sequentially.

5. **Reset**:
   - Use the "Reset" button to clear all entered values and prepare for processing another video.

Error Handling:
---------------
- If a non-MP4 video file is selected, an error message will appear.
- If the start time is later than the end time, an error will occur.
- If a zero or invalid clip length is provided, an error will be shown.
- If a clip name is not provided, the program will prompt you to enter a file name.

Important Notes:
----------------
- The program uses `moviepy` for video processing, which may take some time depending on the length of the video and clip length.
- The generated clips will be saved in the "output" folder. Ensure that this folder exists in the same directory as the program or it will need to be created manually.

Troubleshooting:
----------------
- If the program is not responding, make sure you have installed the required dependencies and that there are no conflicting software versions.
- If the clips are not generating correctly, ensure that the input times are in the correct format (HH:MM:SS).
